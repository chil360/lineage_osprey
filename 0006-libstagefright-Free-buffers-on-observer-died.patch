Subject: [PATCH 06/12] libstagefright: Free buffers on observer died

If observer died while allocating buffers, component remains
in loaded state. In cleanup, it checks for idle state to
free the allocated buffers which leads to memory leak.
Hence explicitly calling free buffers to avoid memory leak.
